# DIY-float-activity
Code for the development of a float prototype to target the oil-water interface, for the activity "Discovering DIY Oceanography: Building Floats to Track Deep Ocean Currents" submitted to Science Activities.<br>

### activity.ipynb:
Main activity file for students. Where measurements need to be input are indicated by '###.' The code should be run one cell at a time by selecting "shift+enter" while in the cell.<br>

### sample.ipynb:
Identical to the activity file, save sample measurements have been input and the cells have all been run. This file is meant to be used for reference by the instructor as an example of reasonable results. <br>

### environment.yaml:
A basic environment file with the required package (numpy) has been provided. However, it should be noted that the base python environment in most (if not all) code editors will more than suffice for the purpose of this activity. Teaching students about python environments is only recommended in particularly code-literate classes and is not the focus of this activity. <br>

### DIYoceanography_slides.pdf and DIYoceanography_slide_notes.pdf:
Sample slides (with presenter notes where necessary) introduce students to the general topic and activity. The original presentation file can be accessed [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGImmYN--c/iOtiFkARIxcFOEZ0pC4XOA/edit?utm_content=DAGImmYN--c&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton 'canva.com'), where the instructor can make an editable copy.
